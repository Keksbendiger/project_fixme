Fixing my life like a software project

I will use this repository to cope with a variety of diseases and to organize my fight agaist the ones I am able to act on.
And to keep track on my progress :)

I decided to keep it public for different reasons:
- I am not ashamed of the conditions this is about.
- I want to raise awareness on the mentioned conditions.
- I want my friends and family who look into it to know how I feel, what currently makes me suffer and how I am going to change it.
- Feel free to message me with tips and experiences you made.
- Feel free to contact me if you think I could help you in any way.

Should I change my mind and think that people should no longer be able to see all this, I will just make it private.


# Organization
Individual problems will be handled as _issues_.

They will always be _labeled_ for easy classification.

There will be a weekly _"sprint meeting"_ to enforce periodic reflection. Schedule: _Saturdays_

_Milestones_ will be used as motivation to achieve specific goals in realistic time frames.

There will be _Documents_ and _diary-like texts_. These will almost always be written in German.
